# petitions-by-locality

This is a WIP project.

## How to install me

1. Download (ie `$ git clone`). 
2. Install dependencies (`$ npm i`)
3. For the AI bits, create a `.env` file: 
    - GEMINI_API_KEY - your API key 
    - GEMINI_MODEL_CODE - the code for the model you want to use 
    - GEMINI_RATE_LIMIT - a rate limit you want to use. This is per minute. 
4. Run `$ npm fetch-data` to fetch the data and associate petitions with topics. 
  - TODO: at the moment, this does not cache topics, so you will need to do this manually by creating SAVED_topics_by_petition.json - this is to be fixedASAP. 
5.  Run `$npm start` and navigate to `localhost:3000`. 

## TODOs:
- Weight constituencies by population, not 1/650 (population might be population or registered voters)
- Implelement proper topics caching non-manually 
- Move on to AWS? 
- Do things with the topics data 
    - Topics dashboard ideas: which topics are popular where? (ie on a map) DONE
    - Click into a topic - what petitions have been created with this topic over time? DONE
    - how salient is a given topic in your constituency NOT DONE
    - do topics vary by salience etc in different areas (I'm sure they do) NOT DONE
    - other interesting questions?

## What is "salience"?

The measure for salience (which should definitely be updated if anyone knows a better one for this data!) works by calculating the ratio between (signatures in a constituency / all signatures) : (1/650). This assumes that each constituency has the same population. That way, if more than `1/650 * total signatures` people in your constituency have signed a petition, it is probably *more salient* in your local area than nationally. This is very much a WIP and rough measure.
